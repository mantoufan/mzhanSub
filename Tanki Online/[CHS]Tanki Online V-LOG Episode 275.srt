1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,590
In today’s episode, we will be wrapping
up the GAME.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:12,507
We’ll also be kicking off a fresh new Ultra
Weekend and searching for the final code.

3
00:00:14,217 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, tankers.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,390
Last Saturday was the fifth and final day
of our quest - The GAME.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,619
We announced the winners on Tuesday, October
20th.

6
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,990
The grand prize went to the player Scorpion321
this year.

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,659
Congratulations; your prize is on the way!

8
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:34,680
The players Yarik and KINGS-HERE also placed
on the podium.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,640
You can see all the winners on the Forum by
clicking on the link in the description.

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,370
This time we took the mistakes of the previous
GAME into account.

11
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,680
It was played only on the weekends.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,030
We tried to maintain a balance of the difficulty
when creating the questions.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,648
If you have any suggestions for the next version
of the GAME,

14
00:00:52,648 --> 00:00:55,134
leave them in the comments under this V-LOG.

15
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,291
We will certainly read and take note of them.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,120
The Ultra Weekend just started today.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,920
All weekend long, you will enjoy the increased
battle funds and experience.

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,299
As usual, Coinboxes and Ultra Containers will
appear in the Shop.

19
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:16,649
You’ll also find a special offer there in
the Shop, which contains 100 000 crystals,

20
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:22,490
50 Ultra Containers, and Coinboxes, all at
a 30% discount.

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,759
In addition to this, there will be 5 new special
missions.

22
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,036
They will not only give you rewards,

23
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,170
but also plenty of bonus stars to finish the challenge faster.

24
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:38,369
A week ago, a lot of you were asking us: “Where
is the V-LOG?”.

25
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:41,909
We took a break from the weekly V-LOG episodes
last Friday.

26
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,799
Instead, we hosted a livestream where we answered
the questions you asked us on the forum.

27
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
Of course, we couldn’t answer all of them,
but many of the questions were duplicated,

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,219
so we made sure to answer these popular ones.

29
00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:00,439
Anyway, the livestream lasted two hours, much
longer than a single episode of the V-LOG.

30
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,740
Not everyone was able to watch the whole livestream,

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,789
so if you missed something, now’s the perfect time to rewatch it.

32
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:10,555
However, before you leave to watch the livestream,
a quick reminder:

33
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:14,220
we’ve hidden the final secret code somewhere in this V-LOG.

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,105
If you find it,

35
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:19,690
remember to enter it in the special form linked in the description of this video.

36
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,852
Next week, we’ll conclude this contest

37
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:25,115
and tell you who the most attentive player was...

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,527
Two years has passed since the last edition
of the TOF Dream Team tournament,

39
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:34,550
but we brought it back for you in 2020!

40
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,537
Due to many changes in the game mechanics
over the years,

41
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,360
the tournament has changed quite a bit.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,990
Brand new overdrives and hull augments have
been added; the mechanics of many turrets,

43
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,410
especially close combat turrets, have changed.

44
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,763
The tournament unleashed the maps in a new
way,

45
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:54,470
especially the oldest "Sandbox" in the new MM version.

46
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,692
The 8 best clans of the TOF Dream Team tournament
met in the Playoffs

47
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:03,300
and played a set of interesting and intense matches to determine the winner.

48
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,625
Control was a real surprise of this tournament,

49
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:11,089
because they beat Eternity in the 1/4 Stage and their another strong opponent, Revenge,

50
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:13,998
who only lost one match in the group stages.

51
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,540
After three maps and six rounds of the first
semi-final, the match resulted in a draw;

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:25,000
the teams went to play penalty rounds, where
Control was able to take the lead and win.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,020
The second semifinal match, Team Pointers
vs.

54
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,680
LaWs, was also played on three maps.

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,780
Here, Mr.BaHbKa123 and his team, Team Pointers,
reached the final with ease.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,221
Meanwhile, in the Lower Bracket, Eternity
was stronger than Can't Stop in the lower grid,

57
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,390
and CoolDown lost to Knockout.

58
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,975
Then, in the Lower Bracket Semi-Finals, Eternity
defeated LaWs,

59
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:55,320
and Knockout made another sensation by
winning against Revenge with a score of 3:2.

60
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,905
The most important matches still remained

61
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,936
In the pre-Finals, Eternity easily knocked out Knockout without problems,

62
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:06,144
guaranteeing themselves a place in the TOP 3.

63
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,664
In the Upper Bracket Finals, the clear favorite,
Team Pointers,

64
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:14,490
and the dark horse of the tournament, Control, faced off.

65
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,094
The match was quite close at the beginning,
but at some point,

66
00:04:18,094 --> 00:04:21,608
Team Pointers were able to latch on to some positive momentum

67
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,926
and take the lead to win with a score of 6:3.

68
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,810
Control moved down to the Lower Bracket Finals,
where Eternity was waiting for them.

69
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,243
In the first two rounds on Barda, Eternity
took one of them in a close fight

70
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:36,724
and took a 1:0 lead.

71
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:41,116
Next up, they played several grueling matchups
on Bobruisk and Gubhaka,

72
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:46,220
and it was a close 3:2 game heading into the fourth map: Red
Alert.

73
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,467
Here, Eternity rallied and took both rounds,

74
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:55,430
earning themselves a spot in the Grand Finals against the widely feared clan Team Pointers.

75
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,580
Heading into the championship match, the heavy
favorites were Team Pointers.

76
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,736
At the very beginning of the tournament, this
particular team was expected to win the championship crown,

77
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:10,341
and as expected, they went through
the entire grid without a single defeat!

78
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:16,815
The match opened on Red Alert, where Eternity
performed brilliantly, winning one and tying the other,

79
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:20,040
starting themselves off with some
positive momentum.

80
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,797
Next up, Sandbox MM, a very unpredictable
map;

81
00:05:23,797 --> 00:05:29,530
it was there that Team Pointers took large leads on many of their rivals during
the tournament.

82
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,482
Instead, Eternity took the initiative on the
map lightning fast

83
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:38,610
and left no chance for their rivals to catch up, let alone take the
lead, in both rounds.

84
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,945
It hit Team Pointers’ morale very hard and
as the match progressed, unfortunately,

85
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:49,460
they were only able to take one round on Bobruisk,
while Eternity grew increasingly stronger.

86
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,303
At the end of eight tough rounds,

87
00:05:51,303 --> 00:05:56,370
Eternity brought home the TOF Dream title with a score of 4:1!

88
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,600
Congratulations to the winners.

89
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,103
We are waiting for the next tournaments!

90
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,413

100
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,840
BOO!

101
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,320
Last time, you had to guess which Hopper would
explode on the mine.

102
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,860
The correct answer is: C
Congratulations to the winners!

103
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,185
And here is the next question:

104
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,680
In which Zone
will Ares be destroyed?
