00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,290
在今天的节目中
我们将澄清关于新底盘的一些信息

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:13,700
公布疯狂周末活动
公布一些密码

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,359
坦克手们，大家好

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,580
周六，我们的新底盘出现在游戏中

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,220
当然，这引起了大家很多疑问

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,140
所以，我们决定对底盘的变化进行了一个小的分析

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,260
showing some not very obvious points and giving a
couple of tips.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,880
First and most importantly, we have changed
the system of kill zones on maps.

9
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,700
This means that now you can be on the roofs
of buildings,

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,510
edges on the border of the map

11
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,350
and even fly over areas that were previously
inaccessible.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,700
But remember that landing outside the map
leads to death.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,700
All this will bring a new look at the familiar
game modes and maps.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,719
The second point directly concerns the overdrive.

15
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,850
The hull jumps due to the jet engine on the
bottom.

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,780
Because of this, the tank is not just jumping
vertically,

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,900
but also takes your current velocity into account.

18
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,620
That is, if you activate the overdrive on
takeoff as you are driving,

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,000
you will fly much further.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,049
In this case, you can activate the jump while
falling into an abyss and save your life.

21
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,980
Also, if you catch a nuclear energy box in
the flight,

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,150
you can double jump by activating your overdrive again while airborne.

23
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,480
In flight, the tank retains control even when
hit.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,950
So you can not only make kills in the air,
but also on the ground.

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,360
Now, goldbox hunting with Hopper has been
taken to the next level.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,070
Don't think it's an overpowered hull.

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,780
It's light, so it cannot take much damage.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,240
It is slower than the other light hulls and
although it accelerates a bit faster,

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,500
it still can't escape from Wasp by jumping from a bomb.

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,619
But it does not matter, the most important
question is if you put a Wasp on top of Hopper,

31
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,900
will it still jump?

32
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,260
The discount weekend has already begun.

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,480
Today, we have a 25 percent discount in the
Shop;

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,340
tomorrow, the same discounts will be applied on Garage items, and on Sunday,

35
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,456
you will be able to upgrade your garage with a 25 percent discount

36
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:17,200
and speed the upgrade up for half the price.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,060
During the discount weekend, we will have
boosted battle funds and experience.

38
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,020
We will also have a special offer in the Shop

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,180
that contains the Hopper hull, Heat and Cold Resistance augments, and 100 Ultra Containers.

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,060
Ultra Containers will be available during
the weekend;

41
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,520
don’t hesitate to buy a few because you know what might “jump” out of them.

42
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,160
We have recently released an update that brought
the auto-shooting mode

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,109
to the mobile version of the game.

44
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,879
The background of this update is not that
confusing.

45
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:50,060
During the last few years,

46
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,859
we have been actively
working on the mobile version of the game

47
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:57,299
and analysing the feedback we were receiving
from you.

48
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,949
The mobile controls were the main problem
for many of you.

49
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,740
By adding the auto-shooting mode,

50
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,780
we intended
to make it easier for you to control your tank

51
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,349
as it removes shooting from the equation
with this feature enabled.

52
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,409
However, after the update, some of you asked
us to have an option to disable this mode,

53
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:15,790
and that’s what we did.

54
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,779
Most of the complaints are about the Railgun
turret.

55
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:20,500
You thought that the auto shooting mode

56
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,459
would let you start charging your railgun even before you see an opponent.

57
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,059
And actually you can do this, but it must
be done manually.

58
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:30,310
Just simply double-tap on the screen.

59
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,650
For continuous shooting, you will have to
hold your finger on the screen after double-tapping.

60
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,230
Some turrets will still have the shooting
button.

61
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,079
Not that old one, but a new switch one.

62
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,930
When it’s on, this button will be holding
a finger on the screen for you.

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,420
This is much more comfortable

64
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,020
than the old
method of firing

65
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,930
with the button held on such turrets as Vulcan or Twins.

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,340
We will continue to follow your feedback

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,620
to make it as comfortable as possible for both new and old players.

68
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,859
We will hide special codes in the next episodes
of the V-LOG.

69
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,689
Your task is to find them and send them through
a form in the description.

70
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,459
Answers should be submitted to this form,
not in the comments.

71
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,300
The winner of this contest will receive

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,000
the fully upgraded Hopper Hull in the maximum modification available for the winner's rank,

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,920
200 000 crystals, and 30 containers.

74
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,540
Second place will receive the Crisis drone,
150 000 crystals, and 20 containers.

75
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,759
Third place will receive an animated paint
(except those available only in special bundles)

76
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,650
70,000 crystals, and 10 containers.

77
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,582
Anyone who placed between 4th and 13th will
each receive 5 containers

78
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,940
and 20 000 crystals each.

79
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,240
Look carefully and do not be distracted

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,380
because both speed and accuracy determine the winner of this contest.

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,320
The first code is already hidden somewhere
in this video, so good luck and get going!

82
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,500
Welcome back to Youtuber Digest, our weekly
selection of best TO videos created by players.

83
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,800
First, watch Jumper as he creates a goldbox
montage

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,789
entirely from our limited time event 'Hovering Railgun' mode.

85
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,600
Did you enjoy this event?

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,900
Second, watch Jay Tanki as he shares with
us some epic highlights from the XP/BP format.

87
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,220
Just a quick reminder, if you want your videos
to be featured in a V-LOG,

88
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,240
then submit your videos in the YouTuber wannabe form,

89
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,700
which can be found in the videos description.

90
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,260
As expected, the new format of TOF Dream Team
turned out to be very interesting

91
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,659
due to the possibility of using overdrives.

92
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:08,020
They presented completely new tactics on absolutely
all maps.

93
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,440
By the way, about them.

94
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,510
For the first time in eSports history, the
Sandbox MM map was added to the map pool,

95
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,800
and it became a real discovery of the tournament

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,509
- a change of leader, quick attacks, comebacks,

97
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,340
surprising tactics - everything can be seen
exactly there...

98
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,240
The group stages are behind us and we congratulate
the teams

99
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,720
and wish them the best of luck in the next round

100
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,610
because the playoff fights
are waiting for them!

101
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:39,180
You can watch all the most interesting battles
as well as participate in the giveaways

102
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,759
on the Tanki Online eSports channel.

103
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,590
Now over to some more eSports news; this time:
Blitz tournaments.

104
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,289
Blitz N23, which was held in the Hard format
and Blitz N24, which was in the Light format,

105
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,410
have ended recently.

106
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,009
24 teams participated in both of these tournaments,
and they were divided into three grids.

107
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,671
Meet the winners:
Team Pointers and Eternity

108
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:07,920
- leaders of the first grid, where clans of First and Second Leagues were battling for the prize,

109
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,689
Knockout and Hello Kitty, who never stop entertaining
us with excellent results for several Blitzes,

110
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:18,150
Aaaaaaand OutLawz and Vertical in the third
bracket.

111
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,380
Create a clan and participate in the Blitz
tournaments

112
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,480
- these are "fast" tournaments where you can win crystals, shot effects,

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,969
Premium and Tankoins by participating every week.

114
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:35,389
The anticipated MotS TRIO tournament with
the coveted Impulse paint as the main prize

115
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:36,990
is waiting for you!

116
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,780
If you have two or three comrades, who like
to play with Railgun,

117
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,830
form a team and register for the tournament!

118
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,830
You can still apply today!

119
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,770
Follow the link in the description and find
out all the details on our eSports portal

120

tankisport.com.

121
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,740
That’s all for this week.

122
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,528
As always, like the video, subscribe, hit
the notification bell,

123
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:03,560
and wait for some fresh news next week;

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,550
we will be announcing something
really cool.

125
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,740
See you later.

126
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,540
BYE!

127
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:21,600
Last time you had to guess which Mammoth with
activated overdrive would destroy Ares.

128
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,280
The correct answer is: E
Congratulations to the winners!

129
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
And here is the new question.

130
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,340
Which Wasp will survive?
