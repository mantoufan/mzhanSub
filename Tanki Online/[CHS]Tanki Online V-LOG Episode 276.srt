1
00:00:02,949 --> 00:00:04,097
In today’s episode,

2
00:00:04,097 --> 00:00:07,720
we will be scaring you with some spooky Halloween festivities.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,357
We’ll also be launching an unprecedented
experiment and introducing a new status effect.

4
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:17,220
Hello, tankers.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,130
We missed you badly and are very happy to
see you all again.

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,410
First off,
Happy Halloween!

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,730
The festive mode is available on THREE maps,
which are selected randomly:

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:35,370
the Graveyard map in 2015 and 2016 versions and the Highland
map from 2013.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,180
Who asked for old Tanki?

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,180
Here you are.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,180
Enjoy!

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,070
Of course,
there will be an increased gold box chance,

13
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,250
as well as boosted funds and experience.

14
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,670
Plus,
we have prepared a lot of special missions.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,920
As usual,
you can complete them only for a limited time,

16
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,820
but a couple of them will be available for
just one day.

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,190
However,
the prize will be special.

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,410
You will find more information in the official
announcement.

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,760
For those who’ve been waiting for sales,
we are pleased to announce that today,

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,990
we have a 30% discount on any item in the
Shop,

21
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,340
tomorrow everything in the garage will be
30% off,

22
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,939
and on Sunday,
you can micro-upgrade your new equipment at a 30% discount,

23
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,640
and speed up those upgrades at half the price.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,299
Also, you will be able to get three Halloween special offers at once with “terrible” discounts.

25
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,679
Ultra Containers will return to the game for
the time of the celebration.

26
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,900
We'll tell you why they are important in just
a second.

27
00:01:33,387 --> 00:01:36,049
Let's talk about Hornet's Overdrive.

28
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,909
We left the radar unchanged.

29
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:42,559
And the ability to ignore the enemy's resists
and armor has turned into a new status effect

30
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,729
Armor-Piercing

31
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,810
We changed the way the Hornets Overdrive works.

32
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,320
The Armor-Piercing effect is not a permanent
effect.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,265
It can be applied only when you activate the
overdrive

34
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:57,109
and only on the opponents who are visible.

35
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:00,960
The duration of the effect will be shorter
than the duration of the overdrive itself.

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,783
Yes,the radius of the effect application is almost unlimited,

37
00:02:04,783 --> 00:02:08,419
the only important factor is that the target must be visible.

38
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,868
Plus, the Armor-Piercing effect will be available

39
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,970
to your teammates as well.

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,569
On the other hand,
the Armor-Piercing effect is a status effect,

41
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,799
and you will be able to equip a special augment
on your hull to protect yourself against it.

42
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,659
It will allow players who understand the situation
on the battlefield better to stand out,

43
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:27,534
and those who played with minimal risk

44
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:31,909
will now lose the ability to easily make the most out of Hornet’s overdrive.

45
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,825
In addition to Hornet,
this status effect can be applied to some turrets

46
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:39,840
if you have the required augments. But there also will be differences.

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,907
For example,

48
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:45,193
a simple shot with Railgun will be enough to activate the Armor-Piercing effect,

49
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:46,712
but Ricochet, for example,

50
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:51,620
will have to hit the opponent with a ricochet from the wall to activate this effect.

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,997
In conclusion,
it will not be possible to give out the effect to everyone easily

52
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:58,428
you will have to try hard to obtain it.

53
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:03,760
You'll need to complete the Halloween special
missions to get them from Ultra Containers.

54
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:08,079
And yes, all of these new augments are already available in the Ultra Containers,

55
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,530
so if you don't want to wait to get your hands on them,

56
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,199
then try your luck by buying some right now!

57
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:18,012
Up next, we have an important topic

58
00:03:18,012 --> 00:03:20,550
as it will bring some major changes.

59
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,870
From November 4th,
we will try a set of changes right in the game.

60
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,283
These changes are designed to increase the
importance of team gameplay

61
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:31,719
while trying not to change the dynamics of the battle.

62
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,753
This test will increase the amount of health

63
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:37,750
and the amount of charge for melee turrets such as Firebird or Isida.

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,891
We will remove larger maps from the Matchmaking
system and focus on 6 vs 6 gamemode

65
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,049
while reducing the length of the battle to 5 minutes.

66
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,440
If all goes as planned,

67
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,683
these changes will allow you to spend more time in the battle itself,

68
00:03:51,683 --> 00:03:54,269
rather than spending time respawning.

69
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:56,689
The testing will last for 2 weeks.

70
00:03:56,689 --> 00:04:00,450
We understand that most of the old players
will not like the changes.

71
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,665
However,
we ask you to play with it for a few days first,

72
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,689
and then, answer the following questions in the comments:

73
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,560
Do you think you had less deaths where you
spawned and were completely useless?

74
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,680
How did the benefit of well-timed overdrives
and drones change?

75
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,649
How did the importance of the team gameplay
change?

76
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,789
Could our experiment change your interest
in the game?

77
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,428
We thank you in advance.

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,630
This Halloween is surely a unique one.

79
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,660
Though we may not be able to go trick-or-treating
in person,

80
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,970
our reporters will ensure we'll all still
have a memorable day here in Tanki.

81
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,360
Just in time for the season,

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,588
the Newspaper has prepared a spooky Halloween special - complete with bone-chilling tales,

83
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:44,639
 
light and humorous holiday-themed articles,

84
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,850
and of course,
a handful of tricks and treats!

85
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,840

hope you enjoy it!

87
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:58,100
Anyway!

88
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,814
The eSports scene is actively growing in Tanki,

89
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:04,437
and there is a pretty good chance that you've read at least one of the many exciting

90
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,480

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,990
We hid some secret codes in the past 4 episodes
of the V-LOG,

102
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,590
which you had to find and enter in a special
form.

103
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,877
When judging the results,

104
00:05:54,877 --> 00:06:00,210
we took not only the correctness of the answer into account,
but also how fast you entered them.

105
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,930
You can see the list of the winners on your
screen.

106
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,000
The winners are also in the description.

107
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,613
Welcome back to Youtuber Digest,

108
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:13,710
our weekly selection of the best TO videos created by players.

109
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,230
Rank ups.

110
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,230
Everyone has them.

111
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,480
But watch Vision TO as he creates for us a
mega montage of rank ups!

112
00:06:29,381 --> 00:06:31,920
Second,
watch Tanki Elite

113
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,673
as he creates a Gold Box montage titled 'Floating in Dreams'.

114
00:06:46,811 --> 00:06:50,669
Quick reminder,
if you want to be featured in a future episode of the V-LOG,

115
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:53,687
then share your videos in the YouTuber Wannabe Form,

116
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:55,678
which can be found in the description.

117
00:06:58,197 --> 00:06:59,870
That's all for this week.

118
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,620
We will see you next time.

119
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,370
But first,
leave a like,

120
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,580
subscribe,
hit the notification bell,

121
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
and watch until the Question of the Week.

122
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,810
And if you don’t leave a like,
you will have the same nightmare over and

123
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,680
over again one week long: everyone will be
using Juggernaut except you!

124
00:07:17,766 --> 00:07:19,138
Bye!

125
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,240
Last time,

126
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,280
you had to guess which zone Ares would be destroyed in.

127
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,140
The correct answer is: С
Congratulations to the winners!

128
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,442
And here is the next question:

129
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:54,442
Which Wasp will land first?
